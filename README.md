# 🚀 Secure and Scalable Static Website Hosting using AWS S3 and CloudFront

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to host a **secure and scalable static website** using **Amazon S3** and **Amazon CloudFront**.  
The goal is to serve a static website (**HTML, CSS, images, etc.**) over **HTTPS**, with high speed and global availability using AWS services.

---

## 🧩 Architecture
1. **Amazon S3** – Stores static website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)  
2. **Amazon CloudFront** – Distributes content globally with low latency and HTTPS  
3. **IAM** – Controls secure access between CloudFront and S3  
4. **Route 53 (Optional)** – Can be used to add a custom domain name

## ⚙️ Steps to Build the Project

### **Step 1: Create S3 Bucket**
* Open **AWS Management Console → S3**  
* Click **Create bucket**  
* Name your bucket (example: `my-static-website`)  
* Uncheck **“Block all public access”** only if hosting directly from S3  
* Keep it checked if using **CloudFront**  
* Upload **index.html** and **style.css**

---

### **Step 2: Enable Static Website Hosting**
* Go to **Properties → Static website hosting**  
* Enable hosting → Select **Host a static website**  
* Note the **Bucket website endpoint**

---

### **Step 3: Set Permissions**
* Add a **Bucket Policy** to allow CloudFront access  
* Example: Use **CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)** for security  

---

### **Step 4: Create CloudFront Distribution**
* Open **CloudFront Console → Create Distribution**  
* Choose **S3 bucket** as Origin  
* Enable **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**  
* Save and deploy → Copy **Distribution Domain Name**

---

### **Step 5: Test Your Website**
* Open the **CloudFront URL** in browser  
* Your static website will now load securely over **HTTPS**
